How to play :

All you need is keyboard.

In the main menu press the initial letter for your selection to select:e.g "S" for "Start",

And I have included a how to and a cheat key introdution in the game menu so just read that before start playing.



Genre: 

The game I am planning to design is a turn-based RPG game, which means you  walk around the map and fight the monsters. The game mode is kind of like Wind Fantasy but kind of different.

Name: 

Legend of paladin

The evil daemons concurred the world and as a paladin itâ€™s your responsibility to defeat the daemons and save the world. 

Goal: 

Your goal is to defeat the boss(of course). (Winning condition)


How to play: 

The map is recorded by a 10*6 table  with different types of landscapes.
The main controller is use up, down, left, and right key to control the movement of of hero.

X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X 

X P P P P P P P P P P P P H H H H X

X H P F F P P P W W W W W W H H X

X ....etc.

In which X shows the border, 

P is plain where your hero and monsters can move and stay on,

How different level differ.

The hard mode the boss will come to you instead of just stay in the same block
